**JavaScript Array Operations**

**Introduction:**
Why `[7,9,2,3][0,3,1]` evaluates to 9? Let's embark on a journey together and unravel the mystery!

```javascript
console.log([7,9,2,3][0,3,1]);
```


**Explanation:**
In this repository, we dissect this code snippet step by step to uncover the fascinating inner workings of JavaScript arrays. Here's what you'll discover:

*Step 1:* [0,1] elegantly transforms into [1]. But why? We explore array subscripts and singular expressions in JavaScript, unveiling the power of comma-separated expressions and the significance of the last expression.

*Step 2:* After the magic, [7,9,2,3][1] emerges, revealing the simplicity of accessing an element at a specific index. Spoiler alert: it's 9! But wait, there's more enchantment to uncover as we explore additional variations and witness JavaScript's spellbinding behavior in action.

*let's check out some other examples*

```javascript
// Example 1
const x = (1,2,3,4,5);
console.log(x); // outputs 5

// Example 2
function alpha() {
    return 'alpha';
}

function beta() {
    return 'beta';
}

function gamma() {
    return 'gamma';
}

const delta = (alpha(), beta(), gamma());
console.log(delta); // Outputs 'gamma'
```
