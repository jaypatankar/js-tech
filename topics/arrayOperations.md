**Why `[7,9,2,3][0,3,1]` evaluates to 9?**

```javascript
console.log([7,9,2,3][0,3,1]);
```


**Explanation:**
In this repository, we dissect this code snippet step by step to uncover the fascinating inner workings of JavaScript arrays. Here's what you'll discover:

*Step 1:* [0,1] elegantly transforms into [1]. But why? We explore array subscripts and singular expressions in JavaScript, unveiling the power of comma-separated expressions and the significance of the last expression.

*Step 2:* After the magic, [7,9,2,3][1] emerges, revealing the simplicity of accessing an element at a specific index. Spoiler alert: it's 9! But wait, there's more enchantment to uncover as we explore additional variations and witness JavaScript's spellbinding behavior in action.

*let's check out some other examples*

```javascript
// Example 1
const x = (1,2,3,4,5);
console.log(x); // outputs 5

// Example 2
function alpha() {
    return 'alpha';
}

function beta() {
    return 'beta';
}

function gamma() {
    return 'gamma';
}

const delta = (alpha(), beta(), gamma());
console.log(delta); // Outputs 'gamma'
```

**Why `Array.from("GoodMorning")[3]` evaluates to d?**

```javascript
const chars = Array.from("GoodMorning")[3];
console.log(chars);
```


**Explanation:**
In this code snippet, we utilize the Array.from() method to convert the string "GoodMorning" into an array of characters. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

*"GoodMorning"* is passed as an argument to Array.from().
Array.from() iterates over each character in the string and creates a new array with each character as an element. So, "GoodMorning" is converted into 
\
['G', 'o', 'o', 'd', 'M', 'o', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g'].
[3] 
\
accesses the element at index 4 of the newly created array, which corresponds to the character "d".
The value "d" is assigned to the variable chars.
Finally, chars is logged to the console, resulting in the output of "d".
\
So, when you run this code snippet, you'll see "d" logged in the console.
